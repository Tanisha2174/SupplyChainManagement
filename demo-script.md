### **[0:15 - 1:45] Detailed Inventory Dashboard Metrics (90 seconds)**

**[Screen: Inventory Dashboard loads]**

**Narrator:** "Let's explore our comprehensive inventory management system. At the top, we see four critical metrics computed in real-time from our backend data."

#### **Key Metrics Section (25 seconds)**
**[Action: Highlight each metric card]**

**Narrator:** "First, **Total Inventory** shows 6,041 units across all selected stores with a 2.5% improvement versus target. Our **Active Agents** - 6 autonomous AI agents operating at 98.2% efficiency, continuously monitoring and optimizing inventory levels."

**[Action: Point to Rebalancing Actions and Efficiency Score]**

**Narrator:** "**Rebalancing Actions** indicates 5 products currently need stock adjustments based on AI predictions. Our **Efficiency Score** of 87% reflects how well our inventory aligns with predicted demand patterns."

#### **AI Demand Forecast Section (35 seconds)**
**[Action: Scroll to and highlight the demand forecast chart]**

**Narrator:** "The AI Demand Forecast section shows our GPT-4o Mini powered predictions. For Dallas stores over 7 days, we predict 6,041 total demand units. Each product has specific confidence levels - milk at 85% confidence with increasing trend, bread at 90% confidence, also increasing."

**[Action: Point to the bar chart comparing predicted demand vs current stock]**

**Narrator:** "The chart compares predicted demand in purple against current stock in gray. Notice how our AI identifies gaps - milk needs restocking while cereal shows excess inventory."

#### **Inventory Recommendations Section (30 seconds)**
**[Action: Highlight the recommendation cards on the right]**

**Narrator:** "Our AI provides specific recommendations for each product. Milk shows increasing trend with 85% confidence - no adjustment needed as stock aligns with demand. Juice requires +20 units due to predicted surge. Bread needs -10 units to prevent waste, while eggs show -30 units recommended due to declining demand patterns."

**[Action: Point to the trend icons and confidence percentages]**

**Narrator:** "Each recommendation includes trend analysis - green arrows for increasing demand, red for decreasing, with confidence percentages guiding decision reliability."
